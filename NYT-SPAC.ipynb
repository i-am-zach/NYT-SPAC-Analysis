    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Special Purpose Acquisition Companies\n",
    "\n",
    "Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs) are companies created solely for the purpose of raising capital through an initial public offering (IPO) with the intention of acquiring an existing private company and taking it public. SPACs are also known as \"blank check\" companies, as they have no operations or business activities at the time of their IPO. SPACs are highly criticized for over selling their companies assets and being a method of enriching insiders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Opportunity is Presented\n",
    "\n",
    "![Stanford Law School](assets/sls-social-default.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Graham Ambrose is a law student at Stanford Law School and the older brother of my good high school friend, Zac. This winter break, Zac reached out to me because Graham was looking for a computer scientist to help assist him with a data science project for his research on SPACs. Not wanting to pass on an opportunity to get my name in law review, I accepted the opportunity and began to message Graham.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Professor Klausner\n",
    "\n",
    "Graham does research for [Professor Michael Klausner](https://law.stanford.edu/directory/michael-klausner/). Klasuner teachers and writer for the Stanford Nancy and Charles Munger School of Business and Stanford Law School. His special research area is in Banking and Financial Institutions, Business & Corporate Law, and Capital Markets. His 2020 publication, *A Sober Look at SPACs,* has been cited by the SEC in proposing regulation to the industry and he is currently suing three SPACs in Delaware Court.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "![Wall Street Bets](assets/WallStreetBets.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In his research, Graham wanted to explore when and why SPACs became so popular. Through platforms like Twitter and Reddit's r/WallStreetBets, SPACs became a financial meme. Using data science, Graham wanted to know exactly when SPACs started becoming popular. SPACs have been financial tools since the 90s but he hypothesizes there's been a sharp increase in the use of SPACs in public knowledge starting in 2020. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "![Translation of SPAC](assets/spac-translation.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Twitter was a popular platform for the promoting and growing of SPACs as a financial meme, it would seem intuitive to scrape twitter content that contain the word \"SPAC\" for our data. However the word \"spac\" means \"to sleep\" in Polish so it would make analysis more complicated. While it would be possible to use an algorithm to determine the tweet was in English or Polish to filter the data, instead we decided to use New York Times articles as a measure of the prevalence of SPACs in public discourse."

    "# Part 1: Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "To collect the data, we are going to use the New York Times API. This API can be found by Googling \"New York Times API\" are going to the URL https://developer.nytimes.com/.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating an App\n",
    "\n",
    "After creating a developer account with the New York Times, we need to create an app in order to obtain our API key. Under the accounts section on the top right, click on \"apps\" > Create New App. I created a new app called \"NYT SPAC Analysis\" and enabled the article search API.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Create New App](assets/nyt/new-app.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the app is created, I copied my public and secret key and saved it to a .env file in my project's root directory. My .env file follows this format:\n",
    "```\n",
    "NYT_API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY>\n",
    "NYT_SECRET_KEY=<YOUR SECRET KEY>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the later parts of the project, I'll load the environment variables from that .env file into my python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploring the Article Search API\n",
    "\n",
    "The New York Times provides documentation for all their API endpoints. For the purpose of this project, we are going to use the article search API. The article search API allows NYT article look ups by keywords. The documentation can be found here: https://developer.nytimes.com/docs/articlesearch-product/1/overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the NYT Article Search API documentation, here is an example API url:\n",
    "\n",
    "```https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?q=election&api-key=yourkey```\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking down the url into its components:\n",
    "* `https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json`: The base url for the article search API\n",
    "* `?q=election`: Query for the keyword \"election\" in NYT articles\n",
    "* `api-key=yourkey`: Dedicated keyword to provide your API key to authenticate the API\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other useful query parameters useful for us:\n",
    "* `sort` = \"newest\" | \"oldest\" | \"relevance\": Sort the API results by chronologically or by relevance. Sorting chronologically will be nice for graphing the data in time series.\n",
    "* `page` = number: The API results are paginated with a max of 10 pages, meaning that to get all results that contain the SPAC keyword, we'll have to exhaust all pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formatting this API url to do a search for articles that include the word \"SPAC\" we get this URL\n",
    "\n",
    "```https://api.nytimes.com/svc/search/v2/articlesearch.json?q=SPAC&sort=oldest&page=1&api-key=yourkey```"

    "## Machine Learning (Topic Modeling)\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling is a type of statistical modeling for discovering the abstract topics that occur in a collection of documents. Essentially, it is a method for finding a group of words (i.e., a topic) from a collection of documents that best represents the information in the collection. It's a form of text mining - a way to identify patterns in a large collection of text data, which we often refer to as a \"corpus\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)\n",
    "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is an example of a topic model and is used to classify text in a document to a particular topic. It builds a topic per document model and words per topic model, modeled as Dirichlet distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The LDA model discovers the different topics that the documents represent and how much of each topic is present in a document. In essence, it assumes that each document in a corpus is a combination of a finite number of topics, and each word in the document can be attributed to one of the document's topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use LDA for Analyzing the New York Times Articles on Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs)?\n",
    "As we have a large number of articles from the New York Times relating to SPACs, it becomes nearly impossible to read through every article and understand the key themes or topics manually. That's where the LDA model becomes particularly useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using LDA for this task helps us automatically discover the main topics discussed in these articles, providing a high-level overview of the common themes. By applying the LDA model, we can find out which topics were most prevalent over time, helping us understand how the discussion around SPACs has evolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can also highlight the context in which SPACs are being discussed, such as in relation to financial regulations, market trends, or specific industries. This information can be crucial in providing a more structured and deep understanding of the news corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, LDA is a powerful tool for analyzing large collections of text data, uncovering hidden thematic structures, and helping in the understanding of large-scale trends and patterns. By using LDA in conjunction with Python's Scikit-Learn library, we can effectively analyze and interpret our corpus of New York Times articles.\n",

SPACs constituted more than 20 percent of the initial public offering market in their heyday in 2007 when, according to SPAC Analytics, they raised more than $12 billion in 66 offerings. Remember, these almost all took place before August of that year, so it was quite a deluge. The reason why SPACs are back in the news is that they are on a literal death march. A typical SPAC must complete its acquisition within 18 months to 2 years, and so the last remaining survivors of the 2007 crop are fighting to stay alive. \n",

    "* Text Analysis: Understanding the structure of the language, including grammar and syntax.\n",
    "* Semantic Analysis: Understanding the meaning of the text.\n",
    "* Sentiment Analysis: Determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in the text.\n",
    "* Text Generation: Creating meaningful text based on certain inputs or requirements.\n",

    "It's one thing to have a lot of articles published on a topic. It's another thing to know if there articles are positive or negative. While some say that all publicity is good publicity, we are interested in finding out more about public awareness and public opinion on SPACs. Whether these articles have positive or negative sentiment to them matters for this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the columns of our NYT articles dataframe is `web_url` which contains the link to the published article on the New York Times website. In theory, we could request the HTML content of all these web pages, scrape the web page so we are only getting the text content, and then running NLP on the text for each article. In practice, this proves to be quite difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Our data frame has roughly 2,500 rows, meaning we'd have to scrape 2,500 websites. Making that many requests to the New York Times would likely cause a rate limit.\n",
    "2. The New York Times puts all its articles behind a paywall and does not load the article's content unless its reader logs in.\n",
    "3. Not all New York Times articles are guaranteed to put their article content in the same HTML tag\n",

    "As we can see from the histogram of sentiment scores on our cleaned dataset, the distribution of the sentiment scores appears to be bimodal with peaks at 0 and 0.9. From the information gathered about the articles' abstract and leading paragraph (*note this is a limitation on the accuracy of our sentiment analysis*) a large amount of sentiments are either neutral or very positive. This result is unexpected as I'd imagine that the sentiment on articles written about SPACs would be closer to neutral or negative.\n",

    "2. Related, the NYT write their articles in such a way that sentiment of their abstracts and leading paragraphs are either in a neutral or positive tone. This would explain the peak around 0.0 as most journalist try to write in an unbiased tone unless they are writing op-eds.\n",
    "3. The NYT writers hold favorable views of SPACs and are writing positive articles on them.\n",

    "Of the explanations, I believe that explanation #1 is most likely. To better tune the model, we could train it on other abstracts and leading paragraph from a random, representative group of NYT articles. This however is outside of the scope of the project but would be interesting to explore."
